<h1>Hello, I'm Gabriel Hernandez! </h1>
I am an early-career IT professional driven by a strong desire to create meaningful and lasting impact through my work. I enjoy building projects that both demonstrate my technical skills and address practical, everyday needs—many of which I find useful in my own life. With a commitment to continuous learning and improvement, I strive to grow into a well-rounded technologist who builds with purpose and integrity.
<h1>IT Professional</h1>
I’m a proud graduate of the Microsoft Data Center Academy with an Associate of Applied Science in Cybersecurity. Through my coursework, I’ve built a strong foundation in IT and cybersecurity principles, and I’m now looking to expand my skills through hands-on technical projects—both professional and passion-driven.
